## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

It's been a while since I last used CSS, so it helped me remember how to center a container within CSS, how to index documents, and how to import Google fonts.


### Continued development

Now I would love to continue with a project that includes HTML and CSS and incorporates functional languages, such as Javascript.
